_("Doubleclick on the text boxes showing the registers value.  You will change its base. The reason why are R5-R7 are in hex are because they usually contain addresses you will learn later")
_("Have you visited the Debug menus yet? I have painstakingly coded a slew of features to support you in your quest to eliminate bugs")
_("Remember that there is no differentiation between instructions and data.  If you look at the columns you can see your data being interpreted as instructions and your instructions being interpreted as plain old numbers.  The bits aren't important its what you choose to do with it that matters.  Remember this.")
_("Want to test your assembly code faster?  See this link - https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6g7zcZaFwPTNUdpbFpQSkEweWs/edit?usp=sharing I encourage you to get with some friends and share test cases.

_("Watchpoints are a useful debugging feature.  You can set a target to be watched for a certain condition ex. R0 == 25 and then when a write occurs to that target and the condition is true then a breakpoint will be triggered")
_("Press Ctrl+G and type an address (even expressions like PC+100 will work too) and the memory view will automatically scroll to that address")
_("Press Ctrl+V to get a new memory view.  This is useful for viewing addresses outside of your program (like the stack)")
_("Did you know that you can Undo instructions by hitting the Back button.  This feature was a pain to code and I hope you utilize it")
_("If you mark a subroutine as a blackbox then you will never step into the subroutine.  If you are already in a subroutine and want to step out of it then hit the FInish button.  If you want to step over a subroutine call then use the Next Line button")
_("Temporary Breakpoints will trigger only once.  This is useful if you want to quickly get to an area of code without stepping a bunch of times")
_("Did you know if you moused over an instruction it will show you your comments for that line of code?")
